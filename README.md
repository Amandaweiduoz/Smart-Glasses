# Smart-Glasses
In previous researches, I explored the relationship between the aesthetically best-fitting glasses of a face and  features of a face. 
I built multiple linear regression models on each glasses feature with dimensions of the face as predictors. 
According to these math models, I developed the application "Smart Glasses" using python, which can generate a model of the best-fitting glasses of a face with a photo of the face. While coding, I imported python libraries numpy and scipy to calculate trigonometrics and some distances, and PyQt5 to set up the interface.
In this repository, I attached the main part of the code used to extract data from a photo of the face, calculate the dimensions needed in the math model, and draw out the shape of the glasses. PyQt5 and fbs is required to run the code.
